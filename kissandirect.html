<p>
It is a modest effort but a revolutionary one to connect the consumers
directly to the farmers and their produce.  This model would dissolve
permanently some of the inveterate problems facing a consumer: access to
quality produce; and facing a farmer: a remunerative price.  Also a myriad
bunch of benefits would accrue both to the farmer and the consumer.

From the above diagram one can clearly see it is just one step to move the
produce from the field to the table of a consumer.  KissanDirect is one way of
making this possible.  We can use technology that is available to remove
redundancies and apprehensions.  The belief here is that if we can build the
trust and tear away the veil of uncertainty between the actual people: the
giver and the taker, a whole slew of benefits will accrue to both the
players.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Agriculture is indeed not much different from child rearing.  The
responsibility and the associated joy seem to be present in both the
activities.  But in the prevailing conditions, does the farmer have the
luxury to look at that way? The farmer has to wage a battle against high
input costs, low prices for his produce, vagaries of the climate, to earn a
decent livelihood.  Institutional support - banks, market places,
co-operative societies, insurance policies - is either non existent or is
being dismantled if any by the neoliberal policies being pursued by the
government.  This leaves the farmer in a desperate situation forbidding any
joy in his profession and in the process forcing him to adopt various
unsustainable methods in the hope of staying afloat the wrecked ship - the
agriculture.  The only choice left before the farmer to offset the high input
costs and low output prices is to raise the output.  The farmer without
realizing enters into a vicious cycle: to increase the output, he applies
higher doses of fertilizer, pesticides thereby increasing the input costs and
in the process agriculture is re-laid on the lines of factory production.
The practices would increase production in the short term but have
deleterious affects in the long term.  Unlike in assembly line production,
dependence of harvest on multiple factors - pests, rainfall, climate (modern
agricultural practices are inadequate to ensure flowering and the ratio of
flowers that would turn into fruit), etc - leaves a farmer moored to a
mountain of debt.  This situation has forced an exodus from farming leaving
only either the brave or for whom agriculture is the only option.  Our model
here would alleviate the condition of the farmer by raising the output price.
This would increase the number of factors to two - size of produce and price
of produce - that a farmer can depend on for the viability of his profession
and provide breathing space to rethink on the present practices of farming.

A new future hinges on the success of this initial offering of KissanDirect.
Transparency should be the pre-requisite for any business and a consumers'
right. With the proliferation of internet devices (3G/4G), farmers and
consumers can connect directly and KissanDirect can provide the platform for
it.  What KissanDirect can do for a consumer:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>ensure the quality of produce as promised by the farmer
</li>
<li>provide mechanism for delivery to the consumer
</li>
<li>provide a barcode to the produce that a consumer buys which can hold
information about:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>quality of the soil,
</li>
<li>nutritional level of the produce,
</li>
<li>the day of harvest,
</li>
<li>number of miles the produce traveled and other relevant information
that a consumer deems necessary for him to make a qualified decision.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
These should enable a consumer to have all the information about each morsel
of food that she eats.  On the production side KissanDirect can ensure the
farmer is the sole beneficiary by eliminating all the middlemen.  Small scale
solar powered processing industries can be set in the villages to process the
produce like milling rice or pulses, extracting oil form seeds.  These will
not only provide employment in the villages but could transform the villages
into cash rich self sustaining units that can finance building modern urban
facilities like sewerage lines, water lines, proper schools, hospitals etc.
